Deep Q-Learning (DQL), or Deep Q-Network (DQN), is a reinforcement learning technique that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function. Unlike traditional Q-learning with its lookup table, DQL can handle high-dimensional state spaces by mapping states to Q-values directly, making it suitable for complex environments like video games and robotics. Key components of DQL include experience replay for breaking data correlations and target networks to stabilize the learning process
